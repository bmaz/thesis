\chapter{Conclusion}

To conclude this thesis manuscript, we first summarize the work that we have presented, then we synthesize the main research perspectives opened by this work.

\section{Summary of the thesis}

First of all, we proposed a novel method to collect tweets in a specific language, based on the use of the most frequent words in a given language. We show that the word distribution of the collected corpus is extremely similar to the word distribution in the sample collected with the Sample API, suggesting that our method provides a subset of the entire stream of tweets that is close to a random sample. Additionally, we show that for a given set of neutral words and a certain number of access tokens to the Twitter API, it is more efficient to use a spectral clustering algorithm in order to group together the terms that are frequently used in co-occurrence than to randomly distribute words
