\subsection{Clusters of terms used as tweet collection parameters} \label{Appendix: Clusters}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

These clusters where obtained using spectral clustering with $K$ clusters on the $(N \times N) $ words co-occurrence matrices.

\section{News media content data\label{Sec:OA_Content}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The content data is from the OTMedia research projet. This projet was subsidized by the \textit{Agence Nationale de la Recherche} (ANR -- National Agency for Research), a French institution tasked with funding scientific research. The INA (\textit{Institut National de l'Audiovisuel} -- National Audiovisual Institute, a repository of all French radio and television audiovisual archives) was the project leader. The OTMedia research projet used the RSS feeds of the media outlets to track every piece of content they produced online. For the media outlets whose RSS feeds were not tracked by INA, we complete the OTMedia data by scrapping the Sitemaps of their website. Finally, we get all the AFP dispatches directly from the AFP.

Our dataset includes the following media outlets:

In Columns (1) and (2), the dependent variable is the number of articles published by the media in the event. In Columns (3) and (4) the dependent variable is an indicator variable equal to one if the media outlet publishes at least one article in the event and to zero otherwise.
